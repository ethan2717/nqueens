This project completes the task described in hw_nqueens.pdf.

Usage
Navigate to the appropriate directory in terminal.
Run the "make" command to compile the code.
Execute the program by running the command "./nqueens <input_file> <output_file>".

The program reads numbers in from the input file. The first number is the size of the chess board.
The subsequent pairs of numbers are the coordinates of the pre-placed queens.
The program then tries to find out the positions of "size" number of queens such that no queen attacks another.
The coordinates of such queens are then outputted to the outfile. If there's not solution, "No solution" is printed.

File description
